# `dms-viz`

Hi there ðŸ‘‹, if you've got some mutation-level data that you want to view on an interactive 3D protein structure, you're in the right place! Pinned below, you'll find a suite of tools aimed at formatting and visualizing this kind of data.

This is an ongoing project, so more information is to come! For now, if you want a taste of what we're trying to build check out [`dms-viz.github.io`](https://dms-viz.github.io/). If you want to try this tool with you're own data, check out the [`configure_dms_viz`](https://github.com/dms-viz/configure_dms_viz) repo for a convienent command line utility.
